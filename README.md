# TypeScript Call Graph

This **CLI** will create an interactive graph of all the functions and their calls in the TypeScript files you provide.

‚ö†Ô∏è This is a work in progress üöß More visualization contributions are welcome.

## How to use

Install globally:

```sh
npm install -g typescript-call-graph
```

Inside any directory, run:

```sh
tcg
```

It will remind you how to use the CLI: you need to provide specific files, or globs (wildcard paths):

```sh
tcg myFile.ts folder/* anotherFolder/**/*
```

## Developing

Clone repository. Edit `index.ts` and/or `extract.ts` and run `npm start` to build changes, `npm test` to run CLI against files in this repository.

Suggestions or PRs for how to improve this CLI are very welcome 	üôá

You may also edit this repository as you'd like and install your custom version of `tcg` command with `npm run global`
